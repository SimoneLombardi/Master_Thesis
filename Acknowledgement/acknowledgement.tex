\begin{acknowledgements}


I want to thanks all the people that helped me during my time at University of Genova, starting with professor Cannata. His assistance was essential in the development of this thesis.
I than extend my depest gratitude to Francesco Grella and Francesco Giovinazzo, them with all the other people of the MACLAB laboratory made me feel welcomed and have given me invaluable advice throughout my journey with them.

On a personal note, I want to thanks all my colleagues of the Robotics Engineering course. The friendship I found are extremely meaningful to shape me in the person I am today.
Last but not least, in the slightest I want to tell my family and friends that their unwavering support and belief in me did not go unnoticed, I would not be here today if it wasn't for them.
